# Client configuration

## Explanation

Once you have successfully downloaded and installed the alt:V Multiplayer client, you will find a "altv.toml" file in
the installation folder.
This file holds various client settings.
By default, the file includes the branch information and the path to your GTA:V installation.
After launching alt:V for the first time, additional settings become available within the altv.toml file.
However, there are additional settings that you can modify.
While most of these settings can be adjusted through the main menu under "Settings," some require direct configuration
in the altv.toml file.
