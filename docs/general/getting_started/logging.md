# Logging

Logging is the process of recording important information or events in a system or application.
It helps to keep a record of what's happening, such as errors, warnings, or specific actions, for troubleshooting and analysis purposes.
Logs provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system, helping developers and administrators understand and resolve issues more effectively.
