## FAQ

### Will the limits of GTA:V be increased?

Yes, alt:V has already increased certain limits compared to the original GTA V.
If you find the need to further increase a specific limit, it can be achieved using a resource packed in the RPF format.
For detailed instructions on how to increase limits using an RPF resource, please refer to the tutorial available [here](PLACEHOLDER LINK).

### Does alt:V work on Linux?

While there are native builds of the alt:V server available for Linux, it's important to note that the alt:V client does not have official support for Linux.
However, some users have reported success running alt:V with compatibility layers such as Wine or Proton.
If you decide to give it a try, you can attempt to run alt:V by installing both GTA V and alt:V within the same Wine prefix.
For further questions, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/altv) and ask in the [altV on Linux](https://discord.com/channels/371265202378899476/988474811258908702) thread.

### Is or will alt:V be open-source?

alt:V consists of a combination of open-source and closed-source components.
While the core parts of alt:V are not open-source, certain components are available as open-source and can be found in the official [alt:V GitHub repositories](https://github.com/altmp).
It's important to note that there are ongoing plans to release additional components of alt:V as open-source in the future.

### Are there any charges for additional server slots?

### How can I get a token for the masterlist?

:::info

During the development stage of your server, you don't need a token.
Tokens are only required if your server is in the release branch and you want it to be listed on the masterlist.

:::

To obtain a token, you can send a message with the word "token" to the alt:V Master-Bot on Discord (username: Master-Bot#3667). There are two requirements to obtain a token:

- Wait for a minimum of 30 days, and a token will be automatically generated for you.
- Alternatively, you can subscribe as a Bronze [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/altVMP) to generate a token immediately.

Either fulfilling the 30-day waiting period or becoming a Bronze Patreon subscriber will allow you to obtain a token for the masterlist.
